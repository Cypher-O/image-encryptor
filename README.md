# Image-Encryptor APP

## Description

This project implements a secure image processor using Python and PyQt5. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by manipulating pixel colors. The primary goal of this project is for educational purposes only, to understand basic image processing and encryption techniques.

## Features

- Encrypts images by swapping pixel color channels.
- Decrypts images to restore the original colors.
- User-friendly interface built with PyQt5 for easy file selection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `PyQt5`
  - `Pillow` (PIL)
